# TV-Script-Simpsons
It generates TV script of "THE SIMPSONS"

I used RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks) to train my model on the 27 seasons of simpsons script.

### Dependencies:
Dependencies include only numpy and tensorflow.

- pip install tensorflow
- pip install numpy

### Warning :
Donot run the model on CPU as it might crash. Instead use cloud computing services like [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) or [FloydHub](https://www.floydhub.com/) and use GPU instance.
