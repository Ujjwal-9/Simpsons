# TV-Script-Generation
It generates TV script of "THE SIMPSONS"

I used RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks) to train my model on the 27 seasons of simpsons script.

### Dependencies:
Dependencies include only numpy and tensorflow.

- pip install tensorflow
- pip install numpy

### Warning :
Donot run the model on CPU as it might crash. Instead use cloud computing services like Amazon Web Services [https://aws.amazon.com/] or FloydHub [https://www.floydhub.com/] and use GPU instance.
